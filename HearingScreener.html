            <p class="articleP">
                In my role as an Application Support Lead I faced into a significant unfinished task from a project. A transition had been done to take 
                stores away from using iPads and to instead use Windows based HP tablets. 
            </p>
            <p class="articleP">
                As part of this project the significant majority of applications that were being used on the iPads were rebuilt for Windows. But, as the 
                project was deemed to be an “optical” project it did not tackle applications that were being used for audiology purposes.
            </p>
            <p class="articleP">
                As the company paid a per device fee for the devices on the Mobile Device Management platform, this left my team having to pay towards a 
                significant number of iPads that were being left in stores to facilitate two applications.
            </p>
            <p class="articleP">
                My line manager challenged me to come up with solutions for how we could move away from these iPads in order to save this money. So, I began 
                trying to build an equivalent application as a Windows WPF application.
